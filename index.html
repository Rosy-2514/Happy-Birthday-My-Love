               <h2>Dear 妈妈(mom),</h2>

<p>
    Happy Birthday to my fav gurlhh  
    The one who knows all my moods, all my drama, all my silly little habits — and loves me anyway.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you for putting up with me and my endless energy, my random ideas, my overthinking, and my nonsense.  
    Thank you for staying close even when I act like I’m independent. Thank you for being there for all my little things — my excitement, my stories, my tiny wins, and even my silly moments.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you for laughing with me, listening to me, supporting me, and just being there in the most beautiful way.  
    Life feels lighter, safer, and happier because you’re in it.
</p>

<p>
    You’re not just my mom, you’re my comfort, my strength, my biggest support system, and my favorite place to run to.  
    I’m so lucky to have you, and I’m so happy to be your daughter.
</p>

<p>
    Today is all about you — your smile, your love, your kindness, your beautiful heart.  
    May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring into my life every single day.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Happy Birthday, My Queen</strong><br>
    No matter how big I grow,<br>
    I will always be your little princess<br>
    I love you endlessly, my chellakutty Mom
